# Exercise 8: Iterate a given list and check if a given element exists as a keyâ€™s value in a dictionary. If not, delete it from the list
# Given:

# roll_number = [47, 64, 69, 37, 76, 83, 95, 97]
# sample_dict = {'Jhon':47, 'Emma':69, 'Kelly':76, 'Jason':97}

# Expected Outcome:

# After removing unwanted elements from list [47, 69, 76, 97]

def check_and_remove(roll_number:list,sample_dict:dict):
    # for num in roll_number:
    #     for value in sample_dict:
    #         if num == sample_dict[value]:
    #             continue
    #         else:
    #             roll_number.dicard(num)
    #             pass
